      I'm currently working on
      <LinkBtn link="https://scarletdynasty.vercel.app">Scarlet Dynasty</LinkBtn
      >, a website for my friend's team. I recently worked on
      <LinkBtn link="https://stust.vercel.app/">Stust</LinkBtn>, a fictional
      card designer. I am also learning GraphQL and UI/UX. Before this, I just
      used to design small projects from Frontend Mentor. It has helped me
      polish my web-development skills.

      I started learning about web-development in my early high-school, where I
      was introduced to HTML and CSS. I quickly started writing small webpages
      with simple HTML and little of CSS. After my high-school, I took some time
      to myself and explored the web development world more and found many
      frameworks. Out of all, I found my love for Vue.js. Since then, I've been
      mastering it, and with every new project I added a new tool, like
      TailwindCSS, Express and more.

      portfolio page but all my recent one's are on github.
